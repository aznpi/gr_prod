            <p>Vendor management and due diligence are best practices for all organizations, particularly for financial firms and other highly regulated organizations who have regulatory obligations to evaluate and monitor their critical vendors. To assist customers with this process, Global Relay engages third party auditors to conduct regular testing on services, internal controls, and data centers. We make the resulting reports available to customers on request.</p>
            <p>These reports can help your compliance, IT, security, and legal teams address:</p>
