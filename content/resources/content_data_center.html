            <h4>Building for the Future</h4>
            <p>As part of our commitment to being a long-term, independent player in cloud archiving and information governance, we have invested heavily in owning our technology stack. We control every aspect of our private cloud — from the software that powers our services, to the servers and networks these services run on, to our primary data center. This primary data center is a custom-built, green facility designed and operated from the ground up by Global Relay. It is currently mirrored with a secure co-location facility equipped with a dedicated Global Relay cage.</p> 
            <p class="bold">Why have we invested in our own data center?</p>
            <p>As we continue to develop new technologies and onboard new customers — including some of the world’s most powerful companies and global banks — we need to quickly scale without compromising our rock-solid reliability and security. Our private green data center ensures we can meet the high standards our customers expect of us. A $60 million capital investment, this facility is a major milestone for our company and a significant investment in our future.</p>

With that in mind, we designed our private data center with the lowest possible carbon footprint.

                                        <h4>Free Air &amp; Evaporative Cooling</h4>
                                        <p>Servers generate massive amounts of heat. Air conditioning to cool these servers is by far the largest use of power in traditional data centers. Instead of air conditioning, we use free air and evaporative cooling.</p>
                                        <p><span class="italic">Free Air Cooling:</span> For most of the year, the data center is kept cool by pulling in fresh outside air and circulating it through the building – a process known as ‘free air cooling.’ The location of our data center, with its mild winters and pleasantly warm summers, allows us to use free air cooling during all but the highest peaks in temperatures, which typically occur less than two weeks per year.</p>
                                        <p><span class="italic">Evaporative Cooling:</span> During temperature peaks, we use ‘evaporative cooling,’ a highly reliable, simple system that uses water – not electricity. The data center uses fans to pull up to 150,000 cubic feet of air (CFM) per minute into the building. This air is run through water blankets that boost the humidity and drop the temperature – basic science and free air-conditioning!</p>

                                        <h4>Power Savings</h4>
                                        <p>During normal operations, the data center is powered by hydroelectricity – a power source that does not create greenhouse gases. In addition the design of our data center cuts electricity usage by 50% when compared to traditional data center designs. We save power through:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Free air and evaporative cooling – no air conditioning required</li>
                                            <li>European standard 400V for power distribution, main breakers, and IT equipment, which is more efficient than the 230V North American standard</li>
                                            <li>Variable frequency drives that ensure fans, motors, and pumps work only as hard as they need to</li>

                                        <h4>Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) System</h4>
                                        <p>If the data center’s primary utility power fails, our backup generators pick up the electrical
load. However, the generators require approximately 6-8 seconds to start.</p>
                                        <p>To prevent downtime during this gap, we use a flywheel UPS system. A flywheel is a rotor that constantly spins around a bearing at 7700 RPM (picture a 660 lb steel donut spinning at very high speed). The flywheels store kinetic energy (energy generated by motion) that is converted into electrical energy. This electrical energy powers the servers during the time it takes for the generators to start.</p>
                                        <p>By using flywheel UPS, we have eliminated the toxic, failure-prone lead-acid battery UPS systems used in most data centers which must be replaced every three years.</p>

                        <p>Our private data center brings a number of benefits for our customers and our company:</p>
                        <p class="bold">Capacity</p> 
                        <p>We provide services to 20,000 customers, including some of the largest multinational organizations. These ever increasing volumes of data these customers produce require massive storage capacity. The 200 rack, 5,000 server, 4-Megawatt capacity of our private data center provides ample resources to meet the needs of this rapidly growing global customer base.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Flexibility &amp; Scalability</p>
                        <p>Our in-house R&amp;D team continually develops new technologies that require dramatic increases in server capacity and computing power. With our own data center, we have the flexibility and scalability to implement and operate the most innovative and complex technologies and services.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Reliability</p>
                        <p>Our private data center is entirely designed, owned, and operated by Global Relay, and not shared with any other organization. This level of control over our computing environment gives us an unprecedented level of reliability and data security.</p>
                        <p>This $60 million capital project is a major milestone for Global Relay and a significant investment in the future of our company. The new data center is a capstone of Global Relay’s long term vision and complements the next generation of our services.</p>

                        <p>Global Relay services run on true enterprise systems, servers, and storage architecture with clustered, fully redundant configurations and automatic failovers, eliminating or minimizing single points of failure. In order to address compliance, availability, and business continuity needs, we host our private cloud in two mirrored SOC-audited data centers separated by more than 2,500 miles. In the unlikely event of a disaster or other significant business disruption, services fail over to the secondary data center to ensure extremely high uptime.</p>
                        <p class="bold">Network</p>
                        <p>We route network traffic between two redundant Tier 1 ISPs providing 10G connectivity. Our two mirrored data centers are connected through redundant 10G WANs. The primary data center is 100% fiber to the rack. We independently manage our network using active-passive redundant BGP routers, with complete control over routing in both optimal and sub-optimal conditions.</p>
