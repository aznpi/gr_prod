            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) established security standards to safeguard protected health information (PHI) created, transmitted or stored electronically. HIPAA also restricts the use and disclosure of PHI in any medium (electronic, paper, or oral) to protect patient privacy. In 2009, the Health Information Technology Act (HITECH) mandated modifications to HIPAA rules to enhance patient privacy, increase patients’ rights to access their PHI, expand the definition of business associates, and toughen enforcement of health care privacy laws.</p>

                         <h4>Recordkeeping</h4>
                        <p>Patients increasingly expect to communicate with their health care providers electronically – by email or
even text message. Providers may also communicate with each other electronically. Electronic communications containing information related to a patient and his or her health care, or used to make a decision related to patient care, may be part of the patient’s medical record and therefore subject to retention requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>Global Relay Archive is an information governance solution for electronic communications that captures and archives an authentic and complete record of your electronic business communications in a secure but easily accessible cloud repository.</p>

                        <h4>Data Security</h4>
                        <p>HIPAA’s Security Rule sets national standards for the security of electronic protected health information (ePHI). It requires all covered entities and business associates to establish and maintain rigorous security controls to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI they create, receive, maintain, or transmit. To meet these requirements, Global Relay enforces administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect customer data.<br/>
