            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requires all firms and individuals that carry out a regulated financial service market activity in the UK to retain orderly records of their business. This recordkeeping obligation extends to written and oral communications with and on behalf of clients. Firms must also establish and maintain supervisory systems and controls appropriate their size and business. Deposit takers, insurance companies, and systemically significant investment firms are also subject to recordkeeping and supervision requirements enforced by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). In addition to these regulations, all UK firms are subject to the UK Data Protection Act, which regulates the processing of personal information.</p>

                        <h4>Data Protection</h4>
                        <p>Global Relay holds and processes personal data in compliance with the DPA. Specifically, we comply with the following provisions:</p>			
                        <p class="bold">Data Transfer Outside the EEA </p>
                        <p>Principle 8 of the DPA prohibits the transfer of personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area unless there is an adequate level of protection in the country of destination. We store all data in two mirrored east/west coast SOC-audited data centers located in Canada. Canada is expressly listed under the DPA as an approved jurisdiction for UK data. As well, the European Commission has twice audited Canada’s privacy laws and determined that they provide protection that is equivalent to or better than the European Privacy Directive.</p>	  			
                        <p class="bold">Data Processing</p>
                        <p>The DPA requires that data controllers who contract with a vendor to process personal data on their behalf ensure the contracted vendor has appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the data being processed. We uniformly classify your data as Sensitive and have implemented physical, organizational, and technical controls to ensure it is secure at all times. We contract with KPMG for annual testing and validation of our business, operational, and security controls to provide independent verification of our representations relating to the security, confidentiality, and protection of data. </p>
