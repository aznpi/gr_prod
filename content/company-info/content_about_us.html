            <h4>Our Services</h4>
            <p>Every day, your employees use platforms like email, instant messaging, and social media to talk to colleagues, customers, counterparties, and the public. These platforms distribute critical information and keep your organization running efficiently. But if left unmanaged, they can also produce a flood of unmanaged data and strain the resources of your IT, legal, compliance, and business teams.</p>
            <p>We help organizations like yours manage and control their data for regulatory compliance, eDiscovery, corporate governance, and data loss prevention. Most importantly, we provide all employees with tools to find the information they need, when they need it - helping them make decisions and your organization stay competitive.</p>

            <h4>Our Story</h4>
            <p>In 1999, we developed one of the first cloud computing services to address the growing need for corporate email management. Since then, as organizations have adopted new methods of communication, data volumes have risen exponentially, and regulatory and corporate governance requirements for recordkeeping and supervision have become increasingly strict, we have continued to innovate to help our customers manage, control, and profit from their data.</p>
            <p>Today, we operate at the intersection of two of the biggest technology trends – cloud and big data. We manage petabytes of critical data for some of the world's largest and most powerful organizations, including 22 of the top 25 banks.  Our 380+ employees in seven offices deliver services to more than 20,000 customers in 90 countries, with a focus on financial services and other highly regulated industries.</p>
