                <p>Global Relay made a $1 million, five-year commitment to resurrect the long tradition of cycling in Gastown in 2012 by restoring a much beloved event that had not run since 2008 for lack of sponsorship. Global Relay’s revival of the race has delighted cycling fans, athletes and the City of Vancouver. Upwards of 30,000 spectators now line the streets of Gastown every July to witness the exhilarating cycling action of the Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix. <a href="${baseUrl}/company-info/grand-prix">more info.</a></p>

Headed by a team of top Canadian cyclists, the program provides much-needed funding, mentorship, coaching, and equipment to help select riders (aged 18-25) reach their national and Olympic goals.</p>
