Eat in the lounge, or take your plate up to our rooftop patio, which overlooks downtown Vancouver and the Burrard Inlet. In the mornings, the lounge is fully stocked with complimentary bagels and toast, with snacks and drinks available throughout the day. At the end of a workday, you might find some staff enjoying a glass of one of the local craft beers that we keep on tap.</div>

The 1.2km cobblestone route has a long and rich history in Gastown — Vancouver’s oldest and most characteristic neighbourhood. With an annual turnout of thousands of cheering spectators, riders and fans love the Gastown race for its challenging course, spectacular finishes and the sheer energy of the huge crowds.</p><p>In 2012, after the race had been on hiatus for several years due to lack of funding, Global Relay stepped in to bring back the race. Global Relay’s involvement with the race is unique. Far beyond just writing a cheque, we made the strategic decision to not only fund, but also manage the event. <a href="/company-info/grand-prix">more info</a></p></div>

Perks (like the resident chef, team and company outings, and GR sports) aside, the strategic executive leadership is inspiring, and makes it very easy to completely believe in what we do here every day. I work on the Sales Team, where hard work has always been recognized and rewarded with opportunities to grow and succeed. GR maintains its 'scrappy' start-up mentality, with all the resources and brand equity of a top-tier organization—which is definitely rare.
