                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>Simply put, the Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix is North America’s favorite criterium (circuit-style race). The 1.2km cobblestone route has a long and rich history in Gastown — Vancouver’s oldest and most characteristic neighbourhood. Past winners of this speedy circuit include cycling stars like Canada’s own Alex Stieda, Alison Sydor and Brian Walton. With an annual turnout of 35,000+ cheering spectators, riders and fans love the Gastown race for its challenging layout, spectacular upsets and sheer energy of the huge crowds.</p>
                            <p>In January, 2012, Global Relay proudly announced a $1-million, five-year commitment to become the Title Sponsor and Operator of one of North America’s most legendary bicycle races — reborn as the Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix. Since the race had not run since 2008 due to lack of a backer, this news was joyfully received by the city of Vancouver and the professional cycling world.</p>
                            <p>With a worldwide customer base, Global Relay is a company that always “thinks globally”. This race, however, couldn’t be more about “acting locally”: our Vancouver office is located directly adjacent to the start/finish line!</p>
                            <h4>Celebrating 40 Years of Professional Cycling in Gastown</h4>
                            <p>To commemorate the 40th anniversary of cycling in Gastown in 2013, we wanted to send the athletes away with something extra special.</p>
                            <p>The top three finishers of both the men’s and women’s races received custom-made and designed gold, silver, and bronze medals to commemorate their victories. These medals were carefully crafted by Pressed Metal Products, a local Vancouver company with over 80 years of industry experience.</p>
                            <p>Global Relay also worked closely with Promosapien to create loads of new Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix gear — including jackets, hats, and messenger bags made from recycled bike tires — to be given to every athlete that competes as a token of our appreciation.</p>
                            <p>Also new for 2013 were Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix cowbells that will be available to the crowd by donation, with 100% of the proceeds going towards the Global Relay Bridge the Gap Fund.</p>

                        <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                        <p>Global Relay’s involvement with this race is unique. Far beyond just writing a cheque, we made the strategic decision to not only fund, but also manage the event.</p>

                        <p>Putting on a world-class sporting event in front of an entire city is no small feat, and as Title Sponsor and Operator of the Race, Global Relay is responsible for every aspect — including logistics, operations, marketing, safety, VIPs, publicity, recruitment, and thousands more details!</p>
                        <p>Without a doubt, it is a lot of work and a significant challenge for our company, but Global Relay staff rally around the event with energy and pride. We mobilize numerous suppliers and contractors, the City of Vancouver and over 250 internal and community volunteers to make this event happen.</p>
                        <p>It truly is exhilarating to witness a pack of top cyclists blazing around the circuit at speeds of up to 60km/h. There is an incredible energy to bicycle racing that can only be experienced at a live event — and with the record crowds and perfect weather on both of our race days so far, the nights have been nothing short of electric.</p>
                        <p>The attendance, media coverage and athleticism displayed at the both the 2012 and 2013 editions of the Global Relay Gastown Grand Prix surpassed everyone’s expectations - 35,000 spectators, thousands of live streaming viewers, and well wishes, tourists and athletes from around the world.</p>

                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Making a community contribution</h4>
                                <p>Global Relay’s business was built from our office in Gastown, Vancouver, and it is still our world headquarters. We found ourselves in the fortunate position of being able to give back to Gastown and the Vancouver community. Outdoor sport and high-octane cycling symbolizes what Vancouver is all about. To sponsor the return of this internationally recognized cycling event is a thrilling honour, as it also helps support local athletes who are able to compete in their own community in front of hometown fans.</p>

                                <h4>Local branding</h4>
                                <p>With 85% of our revenues coming from financial epicentres abroad, Global Relay is better known in New York City and London than in Vancouver despite our headquarters being in Vancouver. What better way to become known at home than by hosting a major public event!</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Recruitment</h4>
                                <p>Being top of mind in Vancouver will help us continue to recruit the best and brightest for our rapidly growing technology and business teams.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Fun</h4>
                                <p>What could be more fun than to host the best summer party in Vancouver?! Free admission, 35,000 spectators, live streaming of the Race worldwide and witnessing 150 of the world’s best cyclists racing around our very own neighbourhood!</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The spirit of teamwork that swept the company leading up to the race and since has been incredible. Global Relay staff all had a role to play, volunteering their time, with many taking critical leadership and planning positions.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-9">
                            <p>In late November 2012, Global Relay, along with a core group of Canada’s top professional cyclists, announced the launch of a $400,000 cycling development program called Global Relay Bridge the Gap. The Global Relay Bridge the Gap Fund provides mentorship, coaching, and financial support to Canada’s up-and-coming cycling talent.</p>
                            <p>The Fund’s Board (Svein Tuft, Andrew Pinfold, Will Routley, Ryan Anderson and Erinne Willock) carefully selected the first group of riders soon after the November 2012 launch. Since then the program has grown to include sixteen athletes from across the country, eleven of whom raced in the 2013 Global Relay Grand Prix. The women’s race champion turned out to be Leah Kirchmann, one of the program participants!</p>
                            <p>We encourage you to learn more about Global Relay Bridge the Gap and follow along with athlete updates as they continue their quest for greatness.</p>
