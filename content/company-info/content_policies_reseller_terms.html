Additionally, for security purposes, Customer shall not, and shall not cause or permit others to: (h) perform social engineering, penetration, or other similar security or vulnerability testing on Global Relay’s Environment without the prior written consent of Global Relay in each case; or (i) cause or use any application to negatively impact, including overloading, spamming, obstructing, or interfering with, the stability or performance of Global Relay’s Systems or Environment. Any illegal or unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or Data is strictly prohibited. Global Relay reserves the right to terminate the Services, in whole or in part, if in its reasonable discretion it determines that any component of the Services or Data is being used by or via Customer for an illegal or unauthorized purpose or in any manner inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement. Customer agrees to notify Global Relay promptly upon becoming aware of any unauthorized access or use.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">4.6.

            <h4>5. GLOBAL RELAY ARCHIVE</h4>
            <p>These additional terms apply where Customer is using Global Relay Archive Services.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">5.1.

Customer is prohibited from delivering Third Party Networks data types which have been converted into email formats to Global Relay Archive to be captured as standard email messages without formally adding such data types to the Services through a Change Order. Global Relay, either directly or via Reseller, reserves the right to charge a Fee for each of such Third Party Networks data type delivered as email messages. Global Relay is not responsible to Customer for any message types or Third Party Networks (including versions and formats) that are not supported, or that are not technically able to be captured or ingested by Global Relay Archive for reasons beyond the control of Global Relay.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">5.2. Monitoring Data Flow.</span> Customer shall monitor its delivery of each data type to Global Relay Archive. Upon Customer’s written request, Global Relay will generate a daily email to Customer that reports statistics on Global Relay’s receipt and processing of each data type from Customer and each Customer User. Customer is responsible to review these reports and to notify Global Relay of any mail flow issues, anomalies, or delivery failures. Customer shall also notify Global Relay of any upgrades, patches, or maintenance to Customer’s servers or data feeds which may result in an outage, disablement of journaling, or other disruption of data flow to Global Relay Archive. Customer shall ensure that no data or messages are transmitted through its email/IM server(s) or otherwise, until Customer’s upgrade, patch, or maintenance has been completed and journaling or data flow to Global Relay Archive has been enabled or reactivated.</p>
            <h4>6. THIRD PARTY NETWORKS</h4>
            <p>These additional terms in Section 6 (Third Party Networks) apply where Customer is using any Services that interoperate with any Third Party Networks, or Email Services.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">6.1. Availability of Third Party Networks.</span> Global Relay does not control and is not responsible for any Third Party Networks, including the products and services of Reseller other than the Services. Such Third Party Networks may change their formats, APIs, delivery methods, or posting times without notice to Global Relay, or may have inaccuracies in format schemas, corruptions or other changes, which may affect the availability or performance of the Services that interoperate with Third Party Networks. Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement, Global Relay does not and cannot warrant the availability or performance of any Third Party Networks, and Global Relay expressly disclaims any and all liability related to, connected with, or arising from Third Party Networks including any outages, delivery delays, delivery methods, corruption of data, processing failures, failure to format data in accordance with such Third Party Network’s data schema, changed or discontinued or failed services, or termination of service. Additionally, Customer is responsible to ensure its end Users only use versions of the applicable Third Party Network or Email Services clients that are expressly supported by Global Relay Services.

Global Relay also reserves the right to discontinue support for any Third Party Network service, temporarily or permanently, upon reasonable advanced notice. Customer agrees that Global Relay shall not be liable to Customer or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of any of the Services; provided however, that in the event Global Relay discontinues any Services, Global Relay will endeavor to provide Customer with reasonable advanced notice. To assist with the administration and maintenance of accurate data flow and user statistics, where an end User of an Account associated with a particular Third Party Network or an Email Service has not accessed that particular Account for more than 60 consecutive days, the User’s license related to such Account will be deemed abandoned and Global Relay may adjust Global Relay’s license count with such Third Party Network or Email Services to account for such User’s inactivity. To regain access, Customer may contact Global Relay Support.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">6.2. Third Party Networks Terms of Use.</span> Customer acknowledges its obligation to comply with any terms of service or terms of use provided by, or any usage fees required by, any Third Party Network or federation of Third Party Networks, including any limitation with respect to restricted or illegal activities. Global Relay shall not be liable for Customer's violation of any such Third Party Network's requirements and Customer shall hold Global Relay harmless for any liability for such violations.</p>

Data Protection.</span> Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Agreement, Global Relay reserves the right, in the event of a reasonable detection or perceived detection of suspicious activity or other security issues whatsoever, including an incident that impacts internet security infrastructure or transmissions in a manner which may cause security risk to Global Relay, Customer, or Archived Data, to temporarily suspend Customer’s access to any of the Services as is necessary. During any such suspension, Global Relay will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve and mitigate the risk and resume Customer's use of the Services and access to the Archived Data as soon as possible and to ensure the integrity of the Archived Data. Any such suspensions will only be in effect during and no longer than a period equal to the time necessary to eliminate risk to Global Relay Services and the Archived Data.</p>

Each party agrees to receive and preserve such Confidential Information as proprietary and confidential information, exercising the same degree of care a reasonable and careful person would exercise with its own confidential information, and in no case will it use less than commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the standards of practice in the industry to prevent unauthorized access to and disclosure of the other party’s Confidential Information. The parties further agree that neither will make Confidential Information of the other party available in any form to, or for the use or benefit of, any Person except as provided in the Agreement, and that neither will use any Confidential Information of the other, or the Services, to compete with the other party in its business.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">8.3. Publication.</span> Global Relay has the right to refer to Customer, directly and indirectly, in marketing materials, case studies and on Global Relay's website to indicate that Customer uses the Services for general information and business purposes regarding Global Relay's customer base. Global Relay shall not issue any press release announcing the engagement or use by Customer of the Services without the express prior written consent of Customer. Any press release or case study shall be subject to the review and prior written approval of both parties and this approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.</p>
            <h4>9. FEES, PAYMENTS &amp; CHANGE ORDERS</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">9.1. Fees and Payments.</span> Where Customer subscribes for the Services through a Reseller, the contractual provisions governing fees and payment terms shall be set out in the Order Form or other agreement between Customer and Reseller. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information, including updates to User counts related to the Services, and for promptly notifying Reseller in order to report any changes to such information to Global Relay.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">9.2. Change Orders.</span> Customer may request New Services from time to time during the Term. <span class="bold">“New Services”</span> are services that are materially different from or in addition to the Services described in the then-current Order Form(s). New Services may include, but not limited to, adding a new data type to be archived, adding ancillary Services, additional functionality, customization of support packages, the import of Legacy Data, or other requirements of Customer that alter the original scope of the Services (but do not constitute Work under Section 2.7 (Development Work)). Customer may be required to execute a Change Order, directly with Global Relay or with Reseller depending on the nature of the New Services, which sets out the New Services subscribed for by Customer, associated costs, scope, and any additional obligations, or effects on the Services set out in the then-current Order Form(s). New Services will be billable from the effective date of the Change Order at the rate specified therein. New Services will be coterminous with the Term for the existing Services.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">9.3. True-ups.</span> Customer may increase its User subscriptions during the Term, provided that Customer promptly reports any increases in User counts to Reseller. Reseller may charge Customer based on the greater of: (a) the minimum set out in Section 9.4 (Subscription Minimum); and (b) Customer’s actual User count.  Global Relay, directly or via Reseller, reserves the right to perform a reconciliation of actual usage/User count versus ordered quantities of Customer’s Service/User subscriptions under the then-current Order Form(s) (<span class="bold">“True-up”</span>). Global Relay shall have the right to audit, and where applicable Customer agrees to make available, or provide access to, Customer’s records reasonably necessary to assist with the True-up. If, as a result of any such True-up or audit, Global Relay reasonably determines that Customer’s use of the Services has exceeded its subscription quantities, or where Customer has reported an increase in User subscriptions, Global Relay, directly or via Reseller, will make the pro-rated adjustments to the corresponding Fees from the start of such excesses or increases and invoice these Fees in the subsequent invoice(s) or in a separate True-up invoice.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">9.4. Subscription Minimum.</span> Subject to Section 9.3 (True-ups), the initial User count stated in Customer’s Order Form (as communicated by Reseller to Global Relay during Customer signup) or the average User count over the last 12 months (prorated if less than 12 months), whichever is higher, will be the minimum billable commitment of Customer unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">9.5. Non-payment.</span> Without limiting other remedies, if a default by Customer related to non-payment for the Services is not promptly remedied to Reseller’s and Global Relay’s reasonable satisfaction following Customer's receipt of written notice of non-payment, Global Relay reserves the right to suspend Customer’s access to any and all of the Services until Customer has paid in full such overdue Fees, plus a $200.00 reactivation fee. Additionally, Global Relay reserves the right to suspend Customer’s access to any and all of the Services if Reseller notifies Global Relay that Customer is in breach or default in the performance of its obligations under an agreement between Reseller and Customer. Neither Reseller nor Global Relay will be liable to Customer for any suspension of access to the Services made in accordance with this Section 9.5 (Non-Payment), and the Fees will continue to apply and accrue during any such suspension. Customer shall not be entitled by reason of set-off, counterclaim, abatement, or other similar deduction to withhold any amount due for the Services.</p>
            <h4>10. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS</h4>
            <p>GLOBAL RELAY IS COMMITTED TO MAKING COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER A HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE AVAILABILITY, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMER’S AND CUSTOMER’S THIRD PARTY NETWORKS AND VENDORS’ COOPERATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, TEMPORARY UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF MAINTENANCE, SOFTWARE RELEASES, HARDWARE RELEASES, SECURITY ISSUES, INTERNET ISSUES, OR CONNECTIVITY ISSUES.

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY GLOBAL RELAY, AND ACCEPTED BY CUSTOMER, ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. GLOBAL RELAY AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OTHERWISE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY OR THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, OR ABOUT THE ACCURACY, SECURITY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF ITS SERVICES, SOFTWARE, OR CONTENT, OR THAT THE SERVICES ARE ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICES AND/OR DOCUMENTATION WILL BE CORRECTED. GLOBAL RELAY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SERVICES WILL SATISFY ANY OF ITS STATUTORY OR REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS, OR WILL ASSIST WITH, GUARANTEE OR OTHERWISE ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CUSTOMER’S LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, OR ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATIONS. CUSTOMER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DETERMINING WHETHER THE SERVICES ARE SUFFICIENT FOR CUSTOMER’S PURPOSES WITH RESPECT TO CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS. NO ADVICE, INFORMATION, INSTRUCTIONS, OR COST PROJECTIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, FROM GLOBAL RELAY OR ITS EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, OR AGENTS, OR THROUGH OR FROM USE OF THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY PROMISE, WARRANTY, OR OBLIGATION NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE AGREEMENT.</p>
            <h4>11. INDEMNITY</h4>
            <p>Customer releases Global Relay from and agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Global Relay, its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and Partners from and against any claims, actions, suits, demands, proceedings brought by third parties (collectively <span class="bold">“Claims”</span>) and any related damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, judgments, awards, costs, or expenses, including reasonable legal fees (collectively <span class="bold">“Damages”</span>), to the extent connected with, arising out of, or related to Customer's: (a) negligence or misuse of the Services, (b) breach of the Agreement, or (c) use of Third Party Networks or combination of the Services with other products, processes, or material not provided by Global Relay, whether or not due to any act, error, omission, or negligence by Global Relay or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, or others whom it is in law responsible.</p> 
            <h4>12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
            <p><span class="bold">12.1. Exclusion of Consequential Damages.</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or any other related agreements, in no event shall either party be liable to the other party, its clients, Affiliates, or any other party (any of which, a <span class="bold">"Person"</span>) under or in relation to the Agreement for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive damages, or loss of use, loss of production, loss or corruption of data, loss of profits or revenues, loss of markets, economic loss, loss of good will, exemplary loss, anticipated or otherwise, that may be suffered or incurred by any Person, resulting from any matter under or related to the Agreement or the use of, inability to use or access, or performance of any of the Services, and notwithstanding that such party may have been advised of the possibility of any such damages and regardless of whether any of the foregoing is determined to constitute a fundamental breach or failure of essential purpose.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">12.2. Limit.</span> Except for Customer’s obligations set out in Section 11 (Indemnity), notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the aggregate liability of either party and its Affiliates to the other party or any Person whatsoever arising out of, in connection with, or related to the Services or the Agreement, whether in contract or tort or under any other theory of liability, including without limitation for any breach of or default under the Agreement or any misrepresentation or negligence, in the aggregate, shall be limited to proven direct damages caused by the party in an amount not to exceed the amount of monthly recurring Fees Customer has paid or are payable to Global Relay under the Agreement in the three months preceding the event giving rise to the liability. This limit is cumulative and the existence of more than one event will not enlarge the limit. The parties acknowledge that these limitations of liability and the allocation of risk, including waiver of consequential damages, are an essential element of the bargain between the parties and part of the consideration for the agreed upon Prices and Fees, and in their absence the Prices and Fees and the Agreement would be substantially different. No action, regardless of form, relating to the Agreement or the Services may be brought by either Party more than two years after the cause of action has accrued under Applicable Law.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">12.3. Mitigation.</span> Each party will have a duty to mitigate damages for which the other party is responsible.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">12.4. Relief.</span> Where Global Relay is in breach of the Agreement, and such breach is attributed to Customer’s act or omission, or a breach by Customer of its obligations under the Agreement, Customer may not exercise any of its rights or remedies in association with such breach of the Agreement by Global Relay, to the extent caused by Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Global Relay and Customer will in such cases, continue to perform its respective obligations as otherwise set out in the Agreement and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cure any such breaches.</p>
            <h4>13. TERM AND TERMINATION</h4>

In the event Customer continues to use the Services to preserve its Archived Data after the Agreement has been terminated, then, unless and until Customer executes an Order Form for the Services directly with Global Relay or otherwise comes to a mutual agreement in writing with Global Relay, Global Relay has the right, without further notice, to: (a) charge Customer for its use of the Services at Global Relay’s Tariff Rate, (b) suspend Customer’s access, (c) disable ingestion of data into Customer’s Global Relay Archive, and (d) delete Customer’s Archived Data in accordance with Section 13.3 (Return or Disposition of Archived Data).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees incurred for the period prior to the effective date of the termination.

                For clarity, the Agreement (incorporating these Master Terms of Service RV) solely applies to the Services of Global Relay provided to Customer via Reseller. In the event that Customer engages Global Relay directly to provide certain services, which may include but are not limited to any archiving services not set out in the Order Form of Reseller, any Professional Services, ancillary services, or Work (collectively <span class="bold">“Direct Services”</span>), then such Direct Services will be governed by the Master Terms of Service: Direct Customer, located at: <a href="https://www.globalrelay.com/company-info/terms-of-use#terms">https://www.globalrelay.com/company-info/terms-of-use#terms</a>.
