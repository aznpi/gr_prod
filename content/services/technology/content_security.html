                        <h4>Systems Security &amp; Legal Protection</h4>
                        <p>Protecting your data is our business. Security, privacy and confidentiality are the fundamental drivers behind all Global Relay's hosted messaging services. To ensure the safe, secure and accurate collection, processing and storage of our customer's data, as well as to prevent unauthorized access, modification or disclosure, industry best practices are deployed at every step. Since security is only as strong as its weakest link - Global Relay arms itself with only the best: two world-class Data Center facilities, high performance systems infrastructure, 24/7 detailed monitoring, bullet-proof, highly redundant archive systems, military-grade encryption and experienced, well-trained employees.</p>
                        <p>Our record speaks for itself. Millions of messages pass through our systems daily, and in over ten years we have never lost a single message.</p>

This comprehensive third party validation is very unique in the hosted messaging industry, and represents an ongoing investment in our customers and partners.
