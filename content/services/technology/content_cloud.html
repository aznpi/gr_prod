                        <h4>What is SaaS?</h4>
                        <p>'Software-as-a-service', 'SaaS', 'hosted', 'web-based', 'online', 'in the Cloud', 'on-demand', 'outsourced', 'Cloud-enabled', all describe similar attributes of Global Relay's software delivery model.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>SaaS is a scalable and flexible software deployment and delivery model.</li>
                            <li>SaaS software and infrastructure are remotely hosted, operated and updated.</li>
                            <li>SaaS resides from a central site off-premise, rather than on-premise.</li>
                            <li>SaaS applications are delivered and accessed over a private network or the Internet via a secure web browser or mobile device, regardless of geographic location of the user.</li>
                            <li>SaaS services are billed through subscriptions or usage licenses on a "pay-for-use" basis rather upfront purchases.</li>
                            <li>To remain competitive in the business world, embracing SaaS technology is key. You are likely already using it. Utilities such as cable or electricity are examples of SaaS. In the business world, Google Apps and SalesForce are familiar examples of SaaS offerings, as well as any mobile service.</li>
                        </ul>
