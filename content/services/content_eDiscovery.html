            <h4>The challenges of eDiscovery</h4>
            <p>Despite widespread use of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) and other best practices, the cost and complexity of eDiscovery is steadily increasing. To meet strict evidentiary demands for litigation and other investigations, your organization must:
              
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Manage</span> the ever increasing torrent of data.
                <li><span class="bold">Identify, collect, and preserve</span> data that is, or may be, relevant to a legal proceeding.
                <li><span class="bold">Search and filter</span> data to cull irrelevant information and reduce the volume of information provided to legal staff for review.
                <li><span class="bold">Produce</span> relevant data in a timely manner in a form that meets the evidentiary requirements of the courts.              
            </ul></p><br>
            <h4>Ensure your data is ready for legal proceedings</h4>
            <p> If your organization is targeted in a lawsuit or chooses to initiate litigation, you need immediate access to historical email and other electronic communications to prove your case and protect your organization. If you do not have an eDiscovery solution in place, the costs associated with etrieving 'deleted' data or information stored on unsophisticated backup systems can be enormous. Global Relay's eDiscovery solution ensures your organization is always litigation-ready - helping you cut costs, save staff time, and promptly produce responsive data.
