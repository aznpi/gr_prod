                            <p>By consolidating your past and present communications data in Global Relay Archive, you can:</p>

                            <p>In order to meet their oversight obligations, regulators need prompt access to firm records. To ensure this access, regulators such as FINRA and the CFTC require each member firm to appoint an independent third party with permission and ability to access and produce the firm’s electronic records. This third party is variously known as a ‘Third Party Downloader’ by the SEC and FINRA and a ‘Technical Consultant’ by the CFTC.</p>
                            <p>Global Relay can act as your independent third party with respect to the data you store in <a href="${baseUrl}/services/archive">Global Relay Archive</a>. Our Legal team will walk you through the appointment process to ensure all parties are protected and your regulatory obligations are met.</p>
