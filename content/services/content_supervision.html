            <p>Your employees constantly communicate with colleagues, customers, partners, and counterparties. These communications distribute critical information and contain unique documentation of your daily operations. But with thousands, or even millions, of communications sent and received every day, it can be difficult to regulate and monitor what your employees, customers, and other external stakeholders are saying.</p>
            <p>Compliance Reviewer gives you the tools to efficiently supervise large volumes of email, IM, texts, social media, and other communications. Our policy-based approach helps you ensure adherence to internal policies and regulatory requirements, reduce legal risks, and protect your corporate reputation.</p>
