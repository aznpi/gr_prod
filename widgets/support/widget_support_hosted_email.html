		<i class="fa fa-level-down"></i>What is POP3?
	</div>
	<div id="hosted-email-2" class="collapse answer">
		<div class="arrow"></div>
		POP3 is an Internet mail protocol (Post Office Protocol) that mail clients use to deliver mail. POP is designed to remove mail from the server as soon as the user has downloaded it using an email application like Outlook. There are settings within Outlook that can allow the user to specify that mail be saved for a particular duration, or after a certain action has taken place.

		<i class="fa fa-level-down"></i>What is IMAP?
	</div>
	<div id="hosted-email-3" class="collapse answer">
		<div class="arrow"></div>
		IMAP is a standard protocol used to access email on servers. IMAP creates a continual connection to the server and only downloads the messages required to review. It also synchronizes the activity in the mailboxes on your desktop with mailboxes on Global Relay's email server.

		<i class="fa fa-level-down"></i>What is Webmail?
	</div>
	<div id="hosted-email-4" class="collapse answer">
		<div class="arrow"></div>
		Webmail is an online, Internet-based mail client that can be used in the replacement of Outlook type email programs. When used at the same time as an IMAP Outlook account all changes made in webmail will reflect in Outlook, as it would the other way around. Webmail is accessed from the Global Relay login page (your full email address and password are required).

		<i class="fa fa-level-down"></i>Should I use POP or IMAP?
	</div>
	<div id="hosted-email-5" class="collapse answer">
		<div class="arrow"></div>
		<p>Today, most business people use Outlook or Outlook Express configured with POP; however, depending on the circumstances, we encourage our Customers to use Outlook or Outlook Express configured with IMAP.</p>
		<p>POP is very restrictive, only allowing you to download email to your desktop. If you have integrated Webmail, you can view new email, but you do not have access to your recently downloaded email, nor can you ever see your Sent Items.</p>
		<p>With IMAP, much like how Hotmail provides you with access to all your folders, IMAP synchronizes all your email and folders giving you access from multiple locations, such as your office and home using Outlook and your webmail. IMAP enables you to send a message from Webmail and have it appear in your Outlook Sent Items seconds later. You can also share accounts with co-workers and easily manage multiple email accounts providing better service to your customers.</p>

		Typically, account creation and the request to change your MX records are sent out within one business day from signing up online. Generally, an MX Record change takes one to two days to propagate over the Internet (so do not cancel your old email account until a few days after transitioning).

	<div id="hosted-email-8" class="collapse answer">
		<div class="arrow"></div>
		<p>If your email client (Outlook, Outlook Express etc.) states that "a connection to the server could not be established" or "mail2(or)3.globalrelay.com could not be found", your Internet connection may down. Troubleshooting recommendations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Verify that you have an Internet connection - connect to any website, and perform a search to verify you have an Internet connection. If you do not have a connection, contact your Administrator or your Internet Service Provider (Global Relay does not provide your Internet connection).</li>
			<li>If your Internet connection is working, login to your Webmail account and verify the email server is reachable (your email address and password are required). If Webmail is not reachable, notify Global Relay.</li>
			<li>If Webmail is reachable and you can successfully login, reboot your computer and click the Send/Receive button in your email application. If you still cannot connect to the server, verify your email application settings (see above) and contact your Administrator. Why am I unable to send email?</li>
			<li>Verify that you have an Internet connection - connect to any website, and perform a search to verify you have an Internet connection. If you do not have a connection, contact your Administrator or your Internet Service Provider (Global Relay does not provide your Internet connection).</li>

			<li>If Webmail is reachable and you can successfully login, reboot your computer and click the Send/Receive button in your email application. If you still can not send email,</li>
			<li>Verify "Authentication" in your email account Properties is selected (typically "my server requires authentication") and,</li>
			<li>Verify your "Outgoing mail server (SMTP)" is using Port 8025 (or secure Port 465, as the case may be) to send email. Reboot your computer and click Send/Receive.</li>
			<li>If your email application still does not work contact your Administrator.</li>
