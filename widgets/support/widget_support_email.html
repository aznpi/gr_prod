	</div>
	<div id="email-2" class="collapse answer">
		<div class="arrow"></div>
		<ol>
			<li>Your firm configures its email server to automatically route a copy of each incoming, outgoing, and internal email and attachment from the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to Global Relay or to a dedicated mailbox. Typically, this is accomplished through a process called journaling. Journaling is a function of Microsoft Exchange, IBM Domino/Notes, and other email platforms that forwards a copy of all emails and attachments to a specified mailbox in real-time. For email platforms that do not support journaling (e.g. Google Mail), we use alternative methods to securely route a copy of all emails and attachments to Global Relay Archive. Please contact our Technical Support team at 866.484.6630 or support@globalrelay.net to obtain a Configuration Guide for your email platform.</li>
			<li>Captured data is securely delivered to Global Relay via an authenticated IMAP or SMTP connection secured with TLS/SSL.</li>
			<li>Global Relay Archive processes, time-date stamps, serializes, and indexes the data, including header information such as Bcc and distribution list recipients.</li>
			<li>Global Relay Archive classifies the processed data as email for easy search and identification.</li>
			<li>Global Relay Archive preserves the data on tamperproof storage for your specified retention term.</li>
			<li>Your authorized users can search and review archived emails and attachments online alongside all other supported data types (e.g. IM, social media, and mobile messaging).</li>

		<i class="fa fa-level-down"></i>What is envelope journaling?
	</div>
	<div id="email-3" class="collapse answer">
		<div class="arrow"></div>
		<p>Envelope journaling is a Microsoft Exchange function that ensures all metadata and header information is archived. An email envelope, similar to a postal envelope, contains the addresses of the email’s recipients. Unlike a postal envelope, it may contain multiple recipients categorized as To, Cc, or Bcc. When you send an email, it is placed in an envelope and sent to the recipients’ mail server(s). When the email arrives at the recipient server(s), the server discards the envelope and distributes a copy of the email to each recipient’s mailbox. Exchange manages domains (e.g. yourcompany.com) within a database known as a "Store." Exchange supports a defined number of Stores. Each Exchange Store can support multiple domains and associated users.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Your firm enables Exchange envelope journaling for its Exchange Store(s) to forward all incoming, internal, and outgoing email and attachments to a journaling mailbox. Once envelope journaling is configured for an Exchange Store, email from or to any new domain in that Store will be automatically journaled.</li>
			<li>Journaled data is delivered to Global Relay Archive via an authenticated IMAP or SMTP connection secured with TLS/SSL. In the event of a network outage, Exchange will queue email internally until the network connection is available.</li>
			<li>Global Relay Archive opens each envelope, analyzes the header, and routes the email, including header information such as Bcc and distribution list recipients, to the appropriate customer Archive.</li>
