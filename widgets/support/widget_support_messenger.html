    <div class="bold quest" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#messenger-16"><i class="fa fa-level-down"></i>What messaging protocol does Global Relay Messenger use?</div>
    <div id="messenger-16" class="collapse answer"><div class="arrow"></div>
        <p>Global Relay Messenger uses the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which is commonly known as Jabber. Jabber is a set of streaming XML protocols and technologies that enable any two entities on the Internet to exchange messages, presence, and other structured information in near real time. Compared to other messaging protocols, Jabber is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Standard:</span> The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has formalized Jabber’s core XML streaming protocols as an approved instant messaging and presence technology.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Proven:</span> The first Jabber technologies were developed in 1998 and are now quite stable. Today, hundreds of developers are working on Jabber technologies, there are tens of thousands of Jabber servers running on the internet, and millions of people use Jabber to exchange IMs.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Secure:</span> Any Jabber server may be isolated from the public Jabber network (e.g., on a company intranet). As well, robust security has been built into the core XMPP specifications.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Extensible:</span> Using XML namespaces, anyone can build custom functionality on top of the core Jabber protocols. To maintain interoperability, common extensions are managed by the Jabber Software Foundation.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Flexible:</span> Jabber applications beyond IM include network management, content syndication, collaboration tools, file sharing, gaming, and remote systems monitoring.</li>
                          
        </ul>

    <div id="messenger-17" class="collapse answer"><div class="arrow"></div>
        <p>The Jabber Software Foundation explains it best: </p>
        <p>"Let's think about two Shakespeare characters and how they exchange messages - perhaps Juliet up on the balcony, and Romeo down in the Capulets' orchard. Now Juliet doesn't send a message directly ("peer to peer") to her Romeo, at least not in the Jabber world. Juliet has an account on a Jabber server, and her Jabber address (we call it a Jabber ID or "JID") looks a lot like an email address. Since Juliet is a Capulet, she registers the username "juliet" with the Jabber server running at capulet.com, so her JID is juliet@capulet.com. Similarly, Romeo has an account on his family's server and his JID is romeo@montague.net. Once Juliet has logged into the capulet.com server, she can send messages to her sweetie. To be precise, here is what actually happens when Juliet fires up the Exodus client on her Windows laptop out on the balcony:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Juliet sends a message addressed to romeo@montague.net</li>
            <li>The message is handled by the Jabber server at capulet.com</li>
            <li>The capulet.com server opens a connection to montague.net</li>
            <li>Assuming that the family elders have not disabled server-to-server communications between capulet.com and montague.net, Juliet's message is routed to the Jabber server at montague.net</li>
            <li>The server at montague.net sees that the message is addressed to an actual user named "romeo" and delivers it to the Jabber client running on Romeo's Linux laptop out in the Capulets' orchard</li>
            <li>The message pops up in Jabber, and Romeo swoons."</li>

    <div class="bold quest" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#messenger-18"><i class="fa fa-level-down"></i>Can Global Relay Messenger communicate with other Jabber networks?</div>
    <div id="messenger-18" class="collapse answer"><div class="arrow"></div>
        <p>Yes. Your Appointed Administrator can enable the ability to communicate with other Jabber networks. This requires the addition of the following custom SRV records to your domain’s DNS:</p>
