	</div>
	<div id="email-filter-0" class="collapse answer">
		<div class="arrow"></div>
		<p>Our Email Filtering is a gateway used to capture, filter, process and then forward all incoming email to a customer's email server. This is accomplished by modifying your domain's MX Record, pointing it to Global Relay's server.</p>
		<p>Your MX record should be changed to point to both of our mail servers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>gateway1.globalrelay.com. [preference of 10]</li>
			<li>gateway2.globalrelay.com. [preference of 10]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Global Relay will require your servers IP address that a) receives the email and b) sends the mail.</p>

		<p>Once you have signed up for the service, a simple modification to the MX records for your domain is required. The MX records will have to point to our Email Filtering server. No hardware or software is required.</p>
		<p>Your MX record should be changed to point to two of our mail servers both with a preference of 10:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>gateway1.globalrelay.com.</li>
			<li>gateway2.globalrelay.com.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Global Relay will require the Host Name or External IP Address of your mail server so we can setup our system to properly redirect filtered mail to.</p>

		Typically, the request to change your MX Records are sent out within one business day from signing up online. Generally, an MX Record change takes one to two days to propagate over the Internet (so don't cancel your old email account until a few days after transitioning).

		<p>For customers using Global Relay Email, you automatically have access to the Email Filtering to manage your own spam. You must activate your account first by logging into the Email Filtering through our Login page using the same username and password that you use for your email.</p>
		<p>If you do not use Global Relay Email, individual user access to Email Filtering must be setup through your Administrator. The Administrator should email support@globalrelay.net with the new user details that include their email address and any aliases that are attached to it.</p>

		<p>Quarantined: When detected Spam messages are set to be quarantined, they will be held for up to 60 days in the Email Filtering Spam Cache. During that time you login to the Email Filtering and confirm their status as a "good" or "spam" email.</p>
		<p>Tagged &amp; Forwarded: When detected Spam messages are set to be tagged, their subject line will contain the prefix of "Spam:" and will be delivered to your Junk Mail folder if you are using Global Relay for your email services or to your Inbox if you are not.</p>

		It is possible that the email was caught by the Filter. If you have access to your own Email Filtering account, look in the JUNK/SPAM folder and confirm the email as "good". If that email is "good" then simply drag and drop that email from the SPAM folder to the Inbox Folder. This should release the email from the Quarantine if your spam is set to be quarantined. If you do not have access to your own Email Filtering account, then contact your Administrator who can contact Global Relay Support to assist in granting you access to your Email Filter and release the message for you.
