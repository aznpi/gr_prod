		<p>As content is added or changed on your website, it creates digital snapshots — proving exactly what your site showed to the public at a given point in time. Each web page is time/date stamped along with a 256-bit digital signature, providing an irrefutable source of evidence in the event of legal action or other situations that require your firm to demonstrate what appeared on its website at a given point in time.</p>
