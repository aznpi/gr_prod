    <h3>UK Financial Firms Resource Page</h3>
    <p>In accordance with the Financial Services Bill, which received Royal Assent in December 2012, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has split into two bodies: a prudential regulator and a conduct regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulates and supervises the conduct of all firms and individuals that carry out a regulated financial service market activity in the UK. Deposit takers, insurance companies, and systemically important investment firms are also supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), whose mandate is to promote the safety and soundness of the UK financial system. </p>
    <p>In addition to FCA and PRA regulations, all UK firms must comply with the UK Data Protection Act of 1998) DPA, which regulates the processing of personal information.</p>
    <p>This page provides an overview of recordkeeping and supervision requirements under Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls (SYSC) Rules 3.1, 3.2, and 9.1 and Conduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS) Rule 11.8.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                    <p>In order to prevent, detect and deter market abuse, COBS Rule 11.8 requires financial firms to record and retain electronic communications related to receiving, negotiating, arranging, or executing client orders. As well, SYSC Rule 9.1 requires firms to keep orderly records of their business, including all services and transactions. With the majority of business being conducted using electronic communications such as email, IM, and text messaging, firms should retain indexed and searchable records of such communications to ensure they can provide regulators with sufficient evidence of compliance with regulatory obligations.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
                    <p>All firms and individuals that carry out a regulated financial service market activity in the UK must comply. This includes mutual societies, banks, financial advisers, investment managers, stockbrokers, building societies, wholesale investment firms and other organizations.</p>

                                <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                                <p>SYSC Rules 3.1 and 3.2 require UK financial firms to develop, establish and maintain supervisory systems
and controls to monitor compliance with regulatory requirements. Each firm must tailor its supervisory systems and controls to its specific business and activities. In Supervision (SUP) 1A.3.2, the FCA describes the principles on which it bases its supervisory approach. These principles include: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>Being more interventionist;</li>
									<li>Being consumer-centric;</li>
									<li>Focusing on firms’ business models and cultures as well as product supervision; and </li>
									<li>Viewing poor behaviour through the lens of its impact on consumers. </li>
									
								</ul>
								<p>With the majority of business, including communications with prospective clients, current clients and the general public, being conducted electronically, firms’ supervisory controls should include the monitoring of electronic communications, including email, IM, mobile messaging and social media. Such supervisory controls can assist firms with efficiently identifying, managing and resolving potential or actual compliance violations.</p>

                                	<li>Develop systems and controls that take into account the nature and scale of the business, the risk associated with each area of operation, the diversity of operations, and the volume and size of transactions;</li>
