	    <p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requires publicly traded companies implement reliable records management practices and controls, including systems to efficiently retain and retrieve data. These requirements are designed to ensure corporate accountability,  accuracy of financial results, and improve the transparency and disclosure of information by public companies and their auditors. The consequences of non-compliance are severe. In addition to fines, depending on the violation, non-compliance can be punished by a period of detention.</p>
		<p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
		<p>Generally, these rules are applicable to all publicly traded companies under the SECâs jurisdiction. However, Sarbanes-Oxley has created a corporate governance benchmark for all businesses to establish and adhere to systematic records management, including email retention policies and practices. </p>
