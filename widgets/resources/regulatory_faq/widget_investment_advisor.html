                    <h4>Recordkeeping</h4>
                    <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                    <p>Regulators do not tolerate inadequate recordkeeping. In response to the explosive growth of email, instant messaging, text messaging, social media and other electronic messages as principal business communication tools, the SEC adopted amendments to Part 275 — Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisors Act, which identifies records relating to investment advisory business that must be retained and imposes requirements regarding the preservation, accessibility and retention periods of all such records. These requirements are designed to protect investors from misrepresentation and fraud and prevent record tampering.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
                    <p>Investment Advisors, including Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds, registered or required to be registered under Section 203 of the Investment Advisors Act. The majority of state-registered Advisors have similar compliance regulations. Note that Rule 204-2(a) requires preservation of records relating to a firm’s “investment advisory business,” which should include the preservation of all electronic communications of a firm’s registered advisors, as well as those of all associated persons to the business.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Requirements</p>
                    <p>Under SEC Rule 204-2 firms must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preserve originals of written communications regarding their investment advisory business;</li>
                        <li>Store electronic records on tamperproof media;</li>
                        <li>Retain records in an easily accessible place for a 5 year retention term from the end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made;</li>
                        <li>Retain records in an appropriate office for the first two years of the retention term<sup>1</sup>;</li>
                        <li>Arrange and index electronic records for easy search, retrieval and access;</li>
                        <li>“Promptly” furnish records to regulators (defined as within 24 hours; online access meets this requirement);</li>
                        <li>Provide legible, true and complete copies and printouts of records to regulators;</li>
                        <li>Provide regulators with means to access, view and print records;</li>
                        <li>Store original and duplicate copies of records in separate locations;</li>
                        <li>Establish and maintain procedures to protect records from loss, alteration or destruction, and to limit record access to authorized personnel and regulators;</li>
                        <li>Ensure electronic reproduction of a hard copy record is complete, true, and legible; and</li>
                        <li>Implement an annual review system and ensure the ability to store review results (cross-referenced with Rule 206(4)-7).</li>
                    </ul>
									  			
                    <p class="bold">Repercussions of Non-Compliance</p>
                    <p>Increasingly, SEC investigations focus on business records and on stricter enforcement of recordkeeping rules. Firms cannot afford to have a lackadaisical attitude toward message management, as the consequences of non-compliance include internal and/or regulatory disciplinary actions, costly penalties, civil liability, damaged corporate reputation and loss of goodwill and clients.</p>
                    <p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> <span class="bold">Appropriate Office Requirement</span> – SEC Rule 204-2(e)(1) requires Investment Advisors to preserve records in an “appropriate office of the investment advisor” for two years. This language was established before the widespread use of cloud computing and electronic data storage. Its spirit was to address the requirement of maintaining the actual physical paper record in an appropriate office of the advisor. As far back as 1995, the SEC clarified that this provision does not require investment advisors to physically store electronic records at their particular local office as long as the records are readily accessible from the office. Today, it well accepted practice for Advisors to engage cloud providers to assist with the record retention function.</p>

                    <h4>Supervision</h4>
                    <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                    <p>It is unlawful for Investment Advisors to provide investment advice to clients unless they implement internal supervisory controls pursuant to Rule 206(4)-7 under the Investment Advisors Act. Advisors are required to establish, maintain and enforce written supervisory policies and procedures to detect and prevent compliance violations, including the misuse of non-public material information. Controls designed to protect investors from misrepresentation and fraud via electronic communications are mandated as part of these supervisory policies and procedures.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
                    <p>Investment Advisors, including Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds, registered or required to be registered under Section 203 of the Investment Advisors Act. The majority of state-registered Advisors have similar compliance regulations. Note that Rule 206(4)-7(a) requires implementation of internal controls to prevent violations by the Advisor and its “supervised persons,” which includes, “any partner, officer, director (or other person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), or employee of an Investment Advisor, or other person who provides investment advice on behalf of the Investment Advisor and is subject to the supervision and control of the Investment Advisor.”</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Implement internal compliance controls designed to detect and prevent regulatory violations;</li>
                        <li>Establish supervisory policies and procedures for all business-related communications with clients, including: (1) methods of detecting and addressing regulatory violations in electronic communications, and (2) restricting such communications if they cannot be adequately archived and supervised;</li>
                        <li>Implement safeguards to protect the privacy of client records and information;</li>
                        <li>Monitor the accuracy of disclosures made to investors, clients, and regulators, including account statements and advertisements;</li>
                        <li>Implement controls for the accurate creation and maintenance of required records in a manner that secures them from unauthorized alteration or use and protects them from untimely destruction;</li>
                        <li>Annually review written supervisory policies and procedures;</li>
                        <li>Designate a chief compliance officer to administer supervisory compliance systems; and</li>
                        <li>Implement an annual review system and ensure the ability to store review results (cross-referenced with Rule 202-4).</li>
