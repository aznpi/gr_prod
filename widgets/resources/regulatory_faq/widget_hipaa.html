                <h4>Privacy Rule</h4>
                <div class="description">
                    <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                    <p>Covered entities and business associates are responsible for complying with increasingly complex, comprehensive regulations to safeguard patient information. The Privacy Rule prohibits covered entities and business associates from using or disclosing PHI except as permitted or required by HIPAA regulations. The Privacy Rule applies to the use and disclosure of all PHI held or transmitted by an organization in any form or media – electronic, paper, or oral. Due to the growth of email, IM, text messaging, and other electronic message types as principle business communication tools in the health care industry, controls designed to protect against unlawful use and disclosures of information via electronic communications should be a fundamental part of any HIPAA-regulated organization’s
privacy policies and procedures.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
                    <p>Health care providers, health plans, health care clearinghouses, and business associates who create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI must comply with the Privacy Rule.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Requirements</p>
                    <p>The Privacy Rule enumerates the permitted uses and disclosures of PHI by covered entities and business associates. The PHI that organizations have a responsibility to protect is broadly defined and includes: personal medical records, genetic information, conversations concerning patient care, billing transactions, and most personally identifiable health information. Permitted uses and disclosures include:</p>

                <h4>Security Rule</h4>
                <div class="description">
                    <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                    <p>The Security Rule sets national standards for the security of electronic protected health information (ePHI). It requires all covered entities and business associates to establish and maintain rigorous security controls to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI they create, receive, maintain, or transmit. Security standards are organized into three categories: administrative safeguards, physical safeguards and technical safeguards. To ensure organization-wide compliance with these standards, regulated organizations should identify all sources and locations of ePHI (including electronic communications), assess the associated security risks, and implement appropriate controls to mitigate these risks.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
                    <p>Health care providers, health plans, health care clearinghouses, and business associates who create, receive, maintain or transmit ePHI must comply with the Security Rule.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Requirements</p>
                    <p>In connection with the Security Rule, organizations must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI they create, receive, maintain, or transmit;</li>
                        <li>Develop and implement security measures that allow them to reasonably and appropriately meet security standards and specifications;</li>
                        <li>Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of ePHI;</li>
                        <li>Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of ePHI that are not permitted or required under HIPAA regulations;</li>
                        <li>Implement policies and procedures to address security incidents;</li>
                        <li>Implement administrative safeguards to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations;</li>
                        <li>Implement physical safeguards to restrict access to information systems and facilities containing ePHI; and</li> 
                        <li>Implement technical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to ePHI</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bold">Repercussions of Non-compliance</p>
                    <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights has the authority to administer and enforce HIPAA regulations and has investigated claims against hospital chains, group health plans, national pharmacy chains, major medical centers, and small provider offices. A civil money penalty may be imposed if HHS determines that a violation has occurred. For violations occurring after February 18, 2009, HHS may impose penalties based on four levels of violations, with corresponding increases in fines. These penalties range from $100 to $1,500,000 for each violation.</p>

                <h4>HITECH</h4>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>In 2009, Congress passed the Health Information Technology Act (HITECH) as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Act required modifications to HIPAA rules to enhance patient privacy, increase patients’ rights to access their PHI, expand the definition of business associates, and toughen enforcement of health care privacy laws. The modified rules became effective on March 26, 2013. The modifications include:</p>
											
                    <p class="bold">Expanded Definition of Business Associates</p>
                    <p>The definition of a business associate has been expanded and clarified to cover all organizations that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of a covered entity. The definition now explicitly includes patient safety organizations, health information exchange organizations, e-prescribing gateways, regional health information organizations, and organizations that provide data transmission services unless they only access data on a “random or infrequent basis.” This exception is known as the “conduit” exception. The conduit exception is narrow and is only intended to exclude organizations acting solely as “courier services.”</p>
                    <p class="bold">Additional Restrictions on Third Party Disclosures</p>
                    <p>An organization that stores or maintains protected health information on behalf of a covered entity is a business associate regardless of whether it views the information it holds. Business associates must comply with the Security Rule and certain provisions of the Privacy Rule.</p>
                    <p>HITECH places additional restrictions on disclosures of PHI for marketing and fundraising, and prohibits the sale of PHI without individual authorization. It also requires modifications to covered entities’ notices of privacy practices.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Mandatory Breach Notifications</p>
                    <p>Under HITECH, covered entities are required to notify affected individuals and the Department of
Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) of a PHI breach. Business associates are required to inform covered entities of breaches. Any data breaches affecting over 500 individuals must be posted on the HHS website.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Increased Enforcement</p>
                    <p>HITECH strengthened the government’s ability to enforce health care privacy laws by increasing
civil suit penalties and establishing more objective standards of non-compliance.</p>
