                <div class="description">
                    <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                    <p>Canadian regulators are no longer tolerating inadequate recordkeeping and supervision of electronic communications.</p> 
                    <p>IIROC Rule 29.7 (supplemented by IIROC Notice 11-0349) requires firms to archive, monitor, and review electronic advertisements, sales literature, and correspondence for clients. IIROC has clarified that “all methods used to communicate, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, blogs, and chat rooms, are subject to the IIROC Rules.” The content of a communication determines whether it is related to a firm’s business, not the method by which the communication takes place.</p> 
                    <p>For mutual fund dealers, MFDA Rule 5 sets out the regulator’s recordkeeping requirements.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the IIROC and MFDA Rules, National Instrument 31-103 requires financial firms to document correspondence with clients.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
                    <p>Generally, these rules are applicable to all persons engaged in trading or acting as a dealer under the jurisdiction of IIROC, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), and/or the MFDA. Canadian companies registered in the U.S. will also be subject to SEC and FINRA requirements.</p>
