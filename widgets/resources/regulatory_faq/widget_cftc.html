With widespread use of electronic communications as primary business communication tools, it is essential to supervise employees' email, IM, social media and other electronic communications in order to identify and resolve any compliance violations.</p>

Below is a summary description of the technology used by Global Relay Archive, as it is important that you have a basic understanding of how Global Relay Archive assists in meeting these CFTC requirements. </p>
                    <p class="bold">Non-Rewriteable, Non-Erasable Storage - (b)(1)(ii)(A)</p>
                    <p class="bold">Rule: Preserve the records exclusively in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format</p>
                    <p>Global Relay Archive preserves copies of all messages and attachments in a tamperproof non-rewriteable, non-erasable format with write verification. Archived messages are stored in our two mirrored east/west coast SOC-audited data centers.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Message Write Verification - b)(1)(ii)(B)</p>
                    <p class="bold">Rule: Automatically verify the quality and accuracy of the storage media recording process</p>
                    <p>Global Relay Archive automatically verifies the quality and accuracy of the storage media recording process as messages and attachments are written to tamperproof storage. As messages are processed, Global Relay Archive automatically compares the post-processed message with the original message before the original message is deleted. Global Relay Archive also uses a 30-day buffer as an added level of redundancy.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Message Serialization - (b)(1)(ii)(C)</p>
                    <p class="bold">Rule: Serialize the original and, if applicable, duplicate units of storage media, and create a time-date record for the required period of retention for the information placed on such electronic storage media.</p>
                    <p>Global Relay Archive sequentially serializes and time-date stamps each message at the time of import. Any message can be retrieved within seconds by serial number. All messages are replicated in near real time between Global Relay's two mirrored east/west coast SOC-audited data centers such that there are always multiple copies of every message preserved.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Index and Record Download - (b)(1)(ii)(D)</p>
                    <p class="bold">Rule: Have the capacity to immediately download indexes and records preserved on the electronic storage media to any acceptable medium upon the request of the Commission or the DOJ.</p>
                    <p>Global Relay Archive full-text indexes all archived messages and preserves both messages and their related indexes for the length of a firm's specified retention period. All archived data is readily available for (i) online access and viewing by authorized users (such as the SEC/FINRA), or (ii) download to DVD, hard drive, or secure FTP.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Additional Information</p>
                    <p>The CFTC Compliance Documentation described above is prepared by Global Relay's in-house lawyers. Any questions may be directed to legal@globalrelay.net.</p>
