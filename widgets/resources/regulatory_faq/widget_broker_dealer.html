                    <h4>Recordkeeping</h4>
                    <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                    <p>In recognition of the explosive growth of email, instant messaging, and now social media as principal business communication tools, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 mandate the preservation and retention of all business-related electronic correspondence. These requirements are designed to protect investors from misrepresentation and fraud and to prevent record tampering. FINRA Rule 4511 cross-references SEC Rule 17a-4 in setting requirements for electronic record formats, mediums, and retention periods.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
                    <p>Generally, these Rules are applicable to all persons engaged in trading securities or acting as a broker, including Broker-Dealer firms and registered representatives subject to the SEC and FINRA. Note that SEC Rule 17a-4(b)(4) requires preservation of all correspondence of a Broker-Dealer “relating to business as such,” which should include the preservation of all electronic communications of a firm’s registered representatives, as well as all associated persons to the business.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Requirements</p>
                    <p>In connection with electronic communications, firms must:</p>
                    <label for="rule-1">(i) SEC Rule 17a-3 and 17a-4</label>
                    <ul id="rule-1">
                        <li>Preserve records of transactions and general securities business, including originals of all communications (incoming, outgoing and internal) related to their “business as such”;</li>
                        <li>Store electronic records in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format, the quality of which must be verifiable;</li>
                        <li>Store original and duplicate copies of records in separate locations;</li>
                        <li>Create and store original and duplicate indexes of electronic records;</li>
                        <li>Have an auditing system in place for all electronic records and store audit results;</li>
                        <li>Retain records for specified periods (3 to 6 years), the first two years in an easily accessible place;</li>
                        <li>Appoint an independent third party with the ability to access and download electronic records upon the request of regulators; and</li>
                        <li>Promptly furnish legible, true, complete, and current copies of records to regulators.</li>								  				
                    </ul>
                    <label for="rule-2">(ii) FINRA Rule 4511</label>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make and preserve books and records as required under the FINRA rules, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable Exchange Act rules;</li>
                        <li>Preserve for a period of six years those FINRA books and records for which there is no specified retention period under FINRA rules or applicable Exchange Act rules; and</li>
                        <li>Preserve books and records in an SEC 17a-4 compliant format and media.</li>	  			
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bold">Repercussions of Non-Compliance</p>
                    <p>Broker-Dealers cannot afford to have a casual attitude toward message management, as the repercussions of non-compliance include internal and/or regulatory disciplinary actions, civil liability, costly penalties, damaged corporate reputation, and loss of goodwill. The imposition of fines for electronic communications recordkeeping violations can range into the millions.</p>

                    <h4>Supervision</h4>
                    <p class="bold">Significance of Rules</p>
                    <p>In response to the ever increasing role of electronic communications in business, regulators have imposed rules requiring firms to supervise business related electronic communications. Broker-Dealers have historically been subject to NASD Rule 3010, which required the supervision and review of incoming and outgoing correspondence. As part of the FINRA rulebook consolidation process, FINRA has replaced NASD Rule 3010 with new FINRA Rule 3110. The new rule expands the obligation to supervise and review business-related correspondence to include internal communications between employees of the same firm. It also incorporates existing guidance from Regulatory Notice 07-59, including standards for risk-based review of correspondence and internal communications.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Who Must Comply</p>
                    <p>Generally, these Rules are applicable to all persons engaged in trading securities or acting as a broker, including Broker-Dealer firms and registered representatives subject to the SEC and FINRA.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Requirements</p>
                    <p>In connection with electronic communications, firms must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop written supervisory policies and procedures for the review of all business-related incoming, outgoing and internal communications;</li>
                        <li>Identify, review and address incoming and outgoing communications (“correspondence”) containing customer complaints, instructions, funds and securities, and content of a subject matter that requires review under FINRA rules and securities laws (and conduct risk-based reviews to determine whether additional supervisory policies are necessary for their business);</li>
                        <li>Identify and review internal communications of a subject matter that requires review under FINRA rules and securities laws, including communications between research and non-research departments, communications with the public that require pre-approval, identification and reporting of customer complaints, and identification and prior written approval of account name changes or designations regarding customer orders (and conduct risk-based reviews to determine whether additional supervisory policies are necessary for their business);</li>
                        <li>Capture, acknowledge, and respond to all written customer complaints;</li>
                        <li>Educate and train employees on procedures governing correspondence, and log such training;</li>
                        <li>Maintain an audit trail and record of supervisory reviews that includes: (i) the identities of both the author and reviewer(s) of the message (ii) the date of review, and (iii) any actions taken;</li>
                        <li>Monitor and evaluate supervisory procedures to ensure compliance;</li>
                        <li>Prohibit individuals from supervising their own activities; and </li>
                        <li>Ensure supervisory systems are not compromised by conflicts of interest.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span class="bold">Note:</span> FINRA Rule 2210 includes retail and institutional communications and correspondence in its requirements regarding communications with the public. FINRA Rule 3130, Annual Certification of Compliance and Supervisory Processes, requires firms to designate a CCO who, together with the CEO, must annually certify to having a process in place to establish, maintain, review, modify, and test policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable rules and laws of the SEC and FINRA. Note also that FINRA Rule 3120 (replacing NASD Rule 3012) requires FINRA members to set up an independent “supervisory control system” to evaluate, test and modify compliance policies and procedures.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Non-Rewriteable, Non-Erasable Storage - (f)(2)(ii)A </p>
                    <p class="bold">Rule: Preserve the records exclusively in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format</p>
                    <p>Global Relay Archive preserves copies of all messages and attachments in a tamperproof non-rewriteable, non-erasable format with write verification. Archived messages are stored in our two mirrored east/west coast SOC-audited data centers.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Message Write Verification - (f)(2)(ii)(B)</p>
                    <p class="bold">Rule: Verify automatically the quality and accuracy of the storage media recording process</p>
                    <p>Global Relay Archive automatically verifies the quality and accuracy of the storage media recording process as messages and attachments are written to tamperproof storage. As messages are processed, Global Relay Archive automatically compares the post-processed message with the original message before the original message is deleted. Global Relay Archive also uses a 30-day buffer as an added level of redundancy.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Message Serialization - (f)(2)(ii)(C)</p>
                    <p class="bold">Rule: Serialize the original and, if applicable, duplicate units of storage media, and time-date for the required period of retention for the information placed on such electronic storage media</p>
                    <p>Global Relay Archive sequentially serializes and time-date stamps each message at the time of import. Any message can be retrieved within seconds by serial number. All messages are replicated in near real time between Global Relay’s two mirrored east/west coast SOC-audited data centers such that there are always multiple copies of every message preserved.</p>
                    <p class="bold">Index and Record Download - (f)(2)(ii)(D)</p>
                    <p class="bold">Rule: Have the capacity to readily download indexes and records preserved on the electronic storage media to any medium acceptable under this paragraph (f) as required by the Commission or the self-regulatory organizations of which the member, broker, or dealer is a member</p>
                    <p>Global Relay Archive full-text indexes all archived messages and preserves both messages and their related indexes for the length of a firm’s specified retention period. All archived data is readily available for (i) online access and viewing by authorized users (such as the SEC/FINRA), or (ii) download to DVD, hard drive, or secure FTP.</p>
