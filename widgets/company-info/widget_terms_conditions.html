Each Administrative User, as a representative of Customer, has the ability, at the sole discretion of Customer to further assign its administrative privileges and access controls under the Administrative Account to other Accounts or Users of Customer. Customer hereby authorizes Global Relay to accept and act on any requests or directions pursuant to a Customer Instruction or otherwise from an Administrative User or any Person that has been assigned such administrative privileges or access controls by an Administrative User.

Customer is prohibited from delivering Third Party Networks data types which have been converted into email formats to Global Relay Archive to be captured as standard email messages without formally adding such data types to the Services through a Change Order. Global Relay reserves the right to charge a Fee for each of such Third Party Networks data type delivered as email messages. Global Relay is not responsible to Customer for any message types or Third Party Networks (including versions and formats) that are not supported, or that are not technically able to be captured or ingested by Global Relay Archive for reasons beyond the control of Global Relay.</p>
<p><span class="bold">5.2. Monitoring Data Flow</span>. Customer shall monitor its delivery of each data type to Global Relay Archive. Upon Customer’s written request, Global Relay will generate a daily email to Customer that reports statistics on Global Relay’s receipt and processing of each data type from Customer and each Customer User. Customer is responsible to review these reports and to notify Global Relay of any mail flow issues, anomalies, or delivery failures. Customer shall also notify Global Relay of any upgrades, patches, or maintenance to Customer’s servers or data feeds which may result in an outage, disablement of journaling, or other disruption of data flow to Global Relay Archive. Customer shall ensure that no data or messages are transmitted through its email/IM server(s) or otherwise, until Customer’s upgrade, patch, or maintenance has been completed and journaling or data flow to Global Relay Archive has been enabled or reactivated.</p>
<p class="bold">6. THIRD PARTY NETWORKS</p>
<p>These additional terms in Section 6 apply where Customer is using any Services that interoperate with any Third Party Networks or Email Services.</p>
<p><span class="bold">6.1. Availability of Third Party Networks</span>. . Global Relay does not control and is not responsible for any Third Party Networks. Such Third Party Networks may change their formats, APIs, delivery methods, or posting times without notice to Global Relay, or may have inaccuracies in format schemas, corruptions or other changes, which may affect the availability or performance of the Services that interoperate with Third Party Networks. Notwithstanding anything else in the Agreement, Global Relay does not and cannot warrant the availability or performance of any Third Party Networks, and Global Relay expressly disclaims any and all liability related to, connected with, or arising from Third Party Networks including any outages, delivery delays, delivery methods, corruption of data, processing failures, failure to format data in accordance with such Third Party Network’s data schema, changed or discontinued or failed services, or termination of service. Additionally, Customer is responsible to ensure its end Users only use versions of the applicable Third Party Network or Email Services clients that are expressly supported by Global Relay Services. Customer may contact Global Relay Support to confirm an updated list of supported Third Party Networks (currently listed here: <a href="/support-training/help-center#public-im">http://www.globalrelay.com/support-training/help-center#public-im</a>). Global Relay also reserves the right to discontinue support for any Third Party Network service, temporarily or permanently, upon reasonable advanced notice. Customer agrees that Global Relay shall not be liable to Customer or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of any of the Services, including Email Services; provided however, that in the event Global Relay discontinues any Services, Global Relay will endeavor to provide Customer with reasonable advanced notice. To assist with the administration and maintenance of accurate data flow and user statistics, where an end User of an Account associated with a particular Third Party Network or an Email Service has not accessed that particular Account for more than 90 consecutive days, the User’s license related to such Account will be deemed abandoned and Global Relay may adjust Global Relay’s license count with such Third Party Network or Email Services to account for such User’s inactivity. To regain access, Customer may contact Global Relay Support.
<p><span class="bold">6.2. Third Party Networks Terms of Use</span>. Customer acknowledges its obligation to comply with any terms of service or terms of use provided by, or any usage fees required by, any Third Party Network or federation of Third Party Networks, including any limitation with respect to restricted or illegal activities. Global Relay shall not be liable for Customer's violation of any such Third Party Network's requirements and Customer shall hold Global Relay harmless for any liability for such violations.</p>
<p class="bold">7. SECURITY</p>
<p class="bold">7.1. Security Procedures and Controls.</p>
<p><span class="bold">7.1.1.  Global Relay</span>. In connection with delivery of the Services and its obligations under the Agreement, Global Relay has implemented and will continually maintain appropriate security procedures, measures, and controls, including appropriate electronic, physical, and organizational security procedures, measures, and controls to reasonably guard against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, destruction, use, alteration, modification, disclosure or loss of Archived Data.</p>
<p><span class="bold">7.1.2.  Customer</span>. In connection with its use of the Services and its obligations under Section 4 (Customer Responsibilities and Use of Services), Customer will continually maintain appropriate security procedures, measures, and controls, including appropriate electronic, physical, and organizational security procedures, measures and controls to reasonably guard against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, destruction, use, alteration, modification, disclosure or loss of Archived Data.</p>
<p><span class="bold">7.2. Data Protection</span>. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Global Relay reserves the right, in the event of a reasonable detection or perceived detection of suspicious activity or other security issues whatsoever, including an incident that impacts internet security infrastructure or transmissions in a manner which may cause security risk to Global Relay, Customer, or Archived Data, to temporarily suspend Customer’s access to any of the Services as is necessary. During any such suspension, Global Relay will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve and mitigate the risk and resume Customer's use of the Services and access to the Archived Data as soon as possible and to ensure the integrity of the Archived Data. Any such suspensions will only be in effect during and no longer than a period equal to the time necessary to eliminate risk to Global Relay Services and the Archived Data.</p>
<p class="bold">8. CONFIDENTIALITY &amp; NON-DISCLOSURE</p>
<p><span class="bold">8.1. Protection of Confidential Information.</span> The parties to this Agreement shall not use any Confidential Information (which term shall include Archived Data) of the other party for its own benefit or for any purpose other than to fulfill its respective obligations under this Agreement. Each party agrees to receive and preserve such Confidential Information as proprietary and confidential information, exercising the same degree of care a reasonable and careful person would exercise with its own confidential information, and in no case will it use less than commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the standards of practice in the industry to prevent unauthorized access to and disclosure of the other party’s Confidential Information. The parties further agree that neither will make Confidential Information of the other party available in any form to, or for the use or benefit of, any Person except as provided in this Agreement, and that neither will use any Confidential Information of the other, or the Services, to compete with the other party in its business.</p>
<p class="bold">8.2. Non-Disclosure Obligations.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">8.2.1.  Non-Disclosure</span>. Neither party shall disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to any Person except:</p>
<p>(a)  to its employees and non-employee representatives who need to know the information to fulfill its respective obligations under this Agreement or in connection with the Services, and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those in this Agreement;</p>
    <p>(b)  where disclosure is required or authorized by Applicable Law or required, compelled, or requested by Governmental or Regulatory Authority or administrative or judicial process or proceeding (collectively <span class="bold">"Legal Process"</span>); or</p>
<p>(c)  with prior written consent of the other party.  </p>
    <p><span class="bold">8.2.2.  Notice</span>. In the event that a party is legally compelled under Legal Process to provide access to the Archived Data or other Confidential Information of the other party, then the disclosing party undertakes, to the extent legally permissible, to promptly provide the other party with written notice of such an event so as to afford the other party the opportunity (at such other party’s cost) to limit, monitor, control or prevent the disclosure. A party’s obligation to provide written notice and the opportunity under the foregoing sentence shall not be interpreted as preventing that party from meeting a deadline or other requirements under Applicable Law or Legal Process. Customer is responsible for all costs to comply with Legal Process and any related disclosure of its Archived Data.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">8.3. Publication</span>. Global Relay has the right to refer to Customer, directly and indirectly, in marketing materials, case studies and on Global Relay's website to indicate that Customer uses the Services and for general information and business purposes regarding Global Relay's customer base. Global Relay shall not issue any press release announcing the engagement or use by Customer of the Services without the express prior written consent of Customer. Any press release or case study shall be subject to the review and prior written approval of both parties and this approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.</p>
<p class="bold">9. FEES, PAYMENTS, AND CHANGE ORDERS</p>
    <p><span class="bold">9.1. Fees and Payments</span>. Customer will execute an Order Form which sets forth the specific terms and Services subscribed for by Customer during the Term. Customer agrees to pay all Fees due under any Order Form or otherwise under this Agreement. Unless alternative payment terms have been specified in the Order Form, Customer shall pay all undisputed Fees (a) on the invoice due date, (b) in advance, based on a quarterly Billing Cycle or an alternative Billing Cycle otherwise stated in the applicable Order Form, and (c) by pre-authorized credit card. Customer, if paying by credit card, hereby gives its authorization for all payments required to keep its accounts current. All credit card payments will normally be processed on the invoice due date. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information, including updates to User counts related to the Services, and for notifying Global Relay of any changes to such information.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">9.2. Change Orders</span>. Customer may request New Services from time to time during the Term. <span class="bold">"New Services"</span> are services that are materially different from or in addition to the Services described in the then-current Order Form(s). New Services may include, but not limited to, adding new data types to be archived, adding ancillary Services, additional functionality, customization of support packages, the import of Legacy Data, or other requirements of Customer that alter the original scope of the Services (but do not constitute Work under Section 2.7). Customer may be required to execute a Change Order which sets forth the New Services subscribed for by Customer, associated costs, scope, and any additional obligations, or effects on the Services set forth in the then-current Order Form(s). New Services will be billable from the effective date of the Change Order at the standard Global Relay Prices unless otherwise specified therein. New Services will be coterminous with the Term for the existing Services.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">9.3. True-ups</span>. Customer may increase its User subscriptions during the Term, provided that Customer promptly reports any increases in User counts to Global Relay. Global Relay reserves the right to perform a reconciliation of actual usage/User count versus ordered quantities of Customer’s Service/User subscriptions under the then-current Order Form(s) (<span class="bold">"True-up"</span>). Upon reasonable advanced notice, Global Relay shall have the right to audit, and Customer agrees to make available, or provide access to, Customer’s internal controls and records reasonably necessary to assist with the True-up. If, as a result of any such True-up, Global Relay reasonably determines that Customer’s use of the Services has exceeded its subscription quantities, or where Customer has reported an increase in User subscriptions, Global Relay will make the pro-rated adjustments to the corresponding Fees invoiced in the subsequent invoice(s) or in a separate True-up invoice.</p>
<p><span class="bold">9.4. Subscription Minimum</span>. During the Term, the initial User count stated in Customer’s Order Form or the average User count over the last 12 months, whichever is higher, will be billable unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">9.5. Fee Dispute</span>. Customer has 30 days from the invoice date to notify Global Relay in writing if there is any Fee dispute or otherwise the invoice will be deemed correct. Any notice by Customer must provide Global Relay with sufficient detail of the claimed Fee discrepancy, and other information that Global Relay may reasonably request, in order to review and resolve the claimed Fee discrepancy. The parties will work together in good faith to diligently resolve the discrepancy. During any resolution period, Customer will continue to pay all undisputed portion of the invoiced amount to Global Relay. If the claimed Fee discrepancy is verified, a pro-rated refund will be issued as a credit note.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">9.6. Non-Payment and Suspension</span>. Any Fees due and owing by Customer (excluding the portion disputed in good faith) under this Agreement that are not received by Global Relay within 30 days of the invoice due date may be subject to a late fee of one and one half percent per month, as calculated from the invoice due date until the date payment is received by Global Relay. Such non-payment constitutes a material default by Customer, and Global Relay may suspend Customer's Services until the overdue amount are paid in full plus a $200.00 reactivation fee. Such suspension will be effected in accordance with the notice requirements and procedures of Section 13.2. Global Relay has no obligation to return Archived Data to Customer until Global Relay receives payment in full of the outstanding balance and any payment disputes are resolved. Customer shall not be entitled by reason of set-off, counterclaim, abatement or other similar deduction to withhold any amount due to Global Relay.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">9.7. Price Adjustments</span>. After the Initial Term, Global Relay may, on an annual basis, increase the Fees by amounts equal to the percent increases in the CPI-U, using the percent change in the level of the CPI-U between the month prior to the Effective Date and that same prior month in each subsequent year. In addition, Prices are subject to change on renewal, upon written Notice to Customer by the end of the then-current term. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, continued use of the Services by Customer for 15 days past the renewal constitutes acceptance by Customer of any Price changes for the Services for the Renewal Term.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">9.8. Taxes of Customer</span>. Fees and any other charges under this Agreement do not include any local, provincial, state, federal, or foreign taxes, levies or duties of any nature, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any jurisdiction (<span class="bold">"Taxes"</span>). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes, excluding only taxes based on Global Relay's net income. If Global Relay has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this Section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Customer unless Customer provides Global Relay with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.</p>

<p class="bold">11. RELEASE</p>
    <p>Customer releases Global Relay from and agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Global Relay, its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and Partners from and against any claims, actions, suits, demands, proceedings brought by third parties (collectively <span class="bold">"Claims"</span>) and any related damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, judgments, awards, costs or expenses, including reasonable legal fees (collectively <span class="bold">"Damages"</span>), to the extent connected with, arising out of, or related to Customer's: (a) negligence or misuse of the Services, (b) breach of this Agreement, or (c) use of Third Party Networks or combination of the Services with other products, processes, or material not provided by Global Relay, whether or not due to any act, error, omission or negligence by Global Relay or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or others whom it is in law responsible.</p>
<p class="bold">12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
<p><span class="bold">12.1. Exclusion of Damages.</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other related agreements, in no event shall either party be liable to the other party, its clients, or any other party (any of which, a "Person") under or in relation to this Agreement for any special, direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive damages, or loss of use, loss of production, loss or corruption of data, loss of profits or revenues, loss of markets, economic loss, loss of good will, exemplary loss, anticipated or otherwise, that may be suffered or incurred by any Person, resulting from any matter under or related to this Agreement or the use of, inability to use or access, or performance of any of the Services, and notwithstanding that such party may have been advised of the possibility of any such damages and regardless of whether any of the foregoing is determined to constitute a fundamental breach or failure of essential purpose.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">12.2. Limit</span>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the aggregate liability of either party and its Affiliates to the other party or any Person whatsoever arising out of, in connection with, or related to the Services or this Agreement, whether in contract or tort or under any other theory of liability, including without limitation for any breach of or default under this Agreement or any misrepresentation or negligence, in the aggregate, shall be limited to proven direct damages caused by the party in an amount not to exceed the amount of monthly recurring Fees Customer has paid to Global Relay under this Agreement in the three months preceding the event giving rise to the liability. This limit is cumulative and the existence of more than one event will not enlarge the limit. The parties acknowledge that these limitations of liability and the allocation of risk, including waiver of consequential damages, are an essential element of the bargain between the parties and part of the consideration for the agreed upon Prices and Fees, and in their absence the Prices and Fees and this Agreement would be substantially different. No action, regardless of form, relating to this Agreement or the Services may be brought by either Party more than two years after the cause of action has accrued under Applicable Laws.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">12.3. Mitigation</span>. Each party will have a duty to mitigate damages for which the other party is responsible.</p>
<p class="bold">13. TERM, SUSPENSION, AND TERMINATION</p>
<p><span class="bold">13.1. Term</span>. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date. This Agreement will continue in effect, together with any subsequent renewals, amendments, or Change Orders until terminated pursuant to this Section 13, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. The Order Form sets out the initial Term for the Services (the “Initial Term”). At the expiry of the Initial Term, the Order Form (including any applicable Change Orders, which shall be coterminous) shall, subject to Section 9.7 (Price Adjustments), be automatically renewed annually for additional one year terms (each a <span class="bold">"Renewal Term"</span>), unless terminated by written Notice by either party at least 90 days prior to the expiry of the Initial Term or Renewal Term (as the case may be), or the parties otherwise negotiate terms of a new Order Form. In the event Customer continues to use the Services beyond the expiry of any Trial Period, the Term, or after a termination date (as applicable) without a valid continuing Order Form , then, without notice to the contrary, Global Relay’s Tariff Rate will apply unless and until the parties mutually agree in writing otherwise.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">13.2. Suspension</span>. Without limiting other remedies, Global Relay reserves the right to suspend any and all of Customer’s Services if Customer is in material breach or default in performance of its obligations under this Agreement or has otherwise violated this Agreement, but only if the reason for that breach, default or violation is not remedied to Global Relay’s reasonable satisfaction within 30 days following Customer's receipt of written Notice of (a) such breach, default or violation, or (b) non-payment pursuant to Section 9.6. Customer shall resolve or cure the specific concerns to Global Relay's (and to Partner's, if applicable) reasonable satisfaction prior to the Services being reinstated. Global Relay will not be liable to Customer for any suspension effected in accordance with this Section 13.2, and the Fees will continue to apply and accrue during any such suspension.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">13.3. Termination</span>. Subject to the provisions of this Section 13 and proper Notice pursuant to Section 14.4 to Global Relay Legal or Customer’s Contact, as applicable, upon termination of the Services by either party, all rights under this Agreement and the provision of Services will terminate in accordance with this Agreement. If Customer is using Global Relay Archive, this includes termination of all access to Global Relay Archive. Neither party will be liable to the other for any termination of the Services in accordance with this Agreement and the following terms:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">13.3.1.  Termination by Customer</span>. Customer may terminate this Agreement (a) at the expiry of the Term in accordance with the Notice requirement of Section 13.1; (b) for cause upon Global Relay's material breach or default in performing its material obligations under this Agreement, if the reason for that breach or default is not remedied within 60 days following Global Relay's receipt of written Notice of such breach or default; or (c) in the case where there is not a governing Order Form, Customer may terminate this Agreement upon 120 days’ Notice. For termination under subsection 13.3.1(b), Customer will not be charged for Fees owed by Customer for the remainder of the Term due after the date of termination and a prorated refund will be given for any Fees prepaid by Customer. In no event shall any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees incurred for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">13.3.2.  Termination by Global Relay</span>. Global Relay may terminate this Agreement (a) at the expiry of the Term in accordance with the Notice requirement of Section 13.1; (b) for cause where Customer has been suspended pursuant to Section 13.2 or upon Customer’s material breach or default in performing its material obligations under this Agreement, if the reason for that suspension, breach or default is not remedied within 60 days following the suspension or Customer's receipt of written Notice of the breach or default (as applicable); or (c) in the case where there is not a governing Order Form, Global Relay may terminate this Agreement upon 120 days’ Notice. For termination under subsection 13.3.2(b), Customer will be charged for any and all Fees owed by Customer for the remainder of the Term and no refund will be given for any Fees prepaid by Customer.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">13.3.3.  Termination on Bankruptcy</span>. A party may terminate this Agreement for cause (a) if the other party, upon proof, is declared insolvent or adjudged bankrupt by a court of competent jurisdiction or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or (b) if a petition in bankruptcy or reorganization or an arrangement with creditors is filed by or against that party and is not dismissed within 60 days. Upon such termination, all Fees owed by Customer up to the date of a valid termination shall immediately be due and payable. If Customer continues to use Global Relay’s Services to preserve its Archived Data, the Fees for Services set forth in the Order Form will continue to apply.</p>
<p><span class="bold">13.3.4.  Transition Assistance Services</span>. Provided Customer’s Fees for the Services have been paid in full for the Term, upon mutual written agreement of Global Relay and Customer, Global Relay will perform custom Services to facilitate Customer’s termination and related transition of Services (the <span class="bold">"Transition Assistance Services"</span>). A new Order Form will be executed by Customer detailing the Transition Assistance Services.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">13.4. Return or Disposition of Archived Data</span>. Customer may:</p>
<p>(a)	engage Global Relay to export a copy of its Archived Data stored by Customer in its Global Relay Archive, for a Fee as set forth in the applicable Order Form, or otherwise at Global Relay’s standard rates, based on the digital media and file format requested and amount of Archived Data to be returned;</p>
<p>(b)	engage Global Relay to preserve a Static Archive of existing Archived Data with online access restricted to the Administrative User, at Global Relay’s standard rates. A new Order Form will be executed by Customer for this Static Archive Service and the applicable Fees will be paid in advance for the entire Term of such engagement; or</p>
<p>(c)	direct Global Relay to permanently delete and dispose the Archived Data at the end of the Contract Term or Retention Term, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>In accordance with Global Relay policy on data retention, Archived Data will not be deleted during the Term until (1) Global Relay has received express written direction from Customer, and (2) the Retention Term has expired. In the event that Customer has not engaged Global Relay to either export a copy of its Archived Data or preserve its Archived Data in a Static Archive in accordance with Section 13.4 (a) or (b) respectively within 120 days following the effective termination of Services, including termination of Services for non-payment (collectively, the <span class="bold">"Abandonment Date"</span>), then Customer is hereby put on notice that Global Relay may, without incurring any liability, securely delete Customer’s Archived Data after the Abandonment Date, and is otherwise not responsible for any of Customer's Archived Data that remains in Global Relay Archive after the Abandonment Date. Global Relay will provide at least 45 days’ Notice before any such final disposition of Archived Data.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">13.5. Survival</span>. The following will survive the termination of this Agreement: Section 3 (Proprietary Rights), 8 (Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure), 10 (Warranties and Disclaimers), 11 (Release), 12 (Limitation of Liability), this Section 13 (Term, Suspension and Termination), Sections 14.4 (Notices and Communications), 14.8 (Governing Law), 14.9 (Dispute Resolution), 14.11 (Non-Solicitation), and any other provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
